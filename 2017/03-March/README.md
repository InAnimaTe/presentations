# The First meeting! Introductions and a Presentation
### Presented by Mario Loria

Join us for our first meeting where we introduce the group, ourselves, and refine the type of meetup we'd like to be.

I (Mario) will be giving a presentation on the State of Service-Oriented Architecture, diving into adopting containers, orchestration platforms, and challenges many are facing.

As Ann Arbor Spark (http://www.annarborusa.org/) has graciously decided to sponsor us, meetings will take place there and we'll have food!

Join us in the #orchestructure channel on madeina2 slack for further discussion. (sign up for madeina2 here (http://madeina2.com/slack))
