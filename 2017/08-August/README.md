# Stupid Hubot Tricks: Patterns with Slack, Jenkins, and Ansible
### Presented by Rex Roof

I've developed patterns to address frustrations I have while doing this thing that people call ChatOps. These demonstrations are meant to show off these patterns and explain my frustrations.

Rex Roof is a Deployment Engineer with Blue Newt Software, he became a Sys Admin in 1995 and has been trying to script his way out of it ever since.
